%% Random Graph Test

% The RandomGraphTest class will generate a 100 nodes graph and permutate
% it a bit. Then test the algorithm on the two graphs.

tStart = tic();
%% Basic Configuration Setup

% How many rounds
rounds = 20;

% The size if the test graph
size = 100;

% The range of the edge rate
weight_range = 10;  % update with edge_compatibility/node_compatibility
% How often two nodes are connected
connected_rate = 0.7;
% How many noise are there
noise_rate = 0.05;

% Node Attribute Flag
